(1)感慨：an over-qualified student,somebody who's I don't know,programmed for Google for the last five years,
is going to have an easy time in this course,but we don't want such a student accidentally intimidating the rest of you.
we don't want you to feel inadequate when you're simply inexperienced.
(2)Skills:use the basic tools of computational thinking(使用计算思维的基本工具)；
          write and read code;
          understand abilities & limits
          map problems into computation（将科学的问题转入计算机框架）
(3)学习方法：you use thoses notes to take your own annotations to(你用那些笔记做自己的注释）help you understand what's going on.
三.talk about computation（计算机）
(1)think like a computer scientist
   -what is computation?(什么是计算相关？)
    -what is knowledge?declarative(陈述性) and imperative(程序性) knowledge.
    陈述性：事实的陈述 z.B.x=y²，y=√2，x=2
    程序性：对推论过程的描述
